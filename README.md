# Tresaure-Hunt
This is an interactive command-line game developed in Python that simulates a treasure hunt. Players navigate a virtual grid or map using directional commands (e.g., north, south, east, west) to search for hidden treasure. The program includes randomized treasure placement, movement tracking, and clues or hints based on proximity to the treasure.
